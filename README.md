# hello-world-
wassup
I'm trying to make a change
Is this coming up or am I still just doing it wrong
I;m trying to learn how yo touch type but I haven;t quite got there just yet. it's pretty hard
I remembver learning at school but I have to look at the keyboard otherwise I'll get typos.
pretty impossinble not to get a few typos...

Just going over a few things again to make sure I've got the hang of this.
